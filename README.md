# The-Finder
A mobile application developed using Android Studio, which locates all nearby restaurants, schools and hospitals. In addition, there is a feature where the user can search for any location on the map, as well as another feature which calculates the distance and duration from one location to another.

# Note
I tried a lot of Api’s and made a lot of projects in console.cloud.google.com but none of the Api’s that I got worked so I had to make a free trial billing account to get an Api that access everything
